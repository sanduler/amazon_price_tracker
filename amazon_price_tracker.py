# Description: This program uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the price of a specified item from
#              Amazon website. The specifies a target price and the program compares the actual price of
#              to it. Once the price is at or bellow the target price the user is notified with an email.


# TODO 1: Find an URL to track
# TODO 2: Use the http://myhttpheader.com/ to find the header needed
# TODO 3: Use the requests library to request the HTML page of the Amazon product using the URL
# TODO 4: Use BeautifulSoup to make soup with the web page HTML you get back. You'll need to use the "lxml"
#      parser instead of the "html.parser" for this to work.
# TODO 5: Use BeautifulSoup to get hold of the price of the item as a floating point number and print it out.
